# ReactJs Coding Notes

Coding notes for ReactJs ^_^



Written for OpenSUTD since there is no one written that.



### Pre-requisite

------

- Javascript: You learn it up on my my javascript coding notes:
- HTML & CSS: Yup! You need it. They are the trio to make web dev possible!
  - Fyi, If you think that HTML is a programming language then I suggest you read/ research before embarking on learning ReactJs. Teehee!
- LOTS OF RESILENCE
  - Actually, that applies for all programming stuff... Especially the debugging. And Don't complain about it, but rather learn from them!

Okay! Let's get started then



## Installation

You would need to install 

- node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/   // Please install this first!

- ReactJs & React-Dom:

   Type in CLI:

```
npm install react react-dom --save
```

- Webpack:

```
npm install webpack webpack-dev-server webpack-cli --save
```

- Babel:

```
npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-env 
   babel-preset-react html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```



What I did just install?

Webpack: An open-source JavaScript module bundler. A tool for bundling application source code in convenient chunks and for loading that code from a server into a browser.

Babel:  A free and open-source JavaScript compiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines.

Strongly Recommended:
